     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>My name is CJ, I am currently in a rotation program at Google,
      the Cloud Technical Residency program, and I am working as a Technical Account
      Manager for Unity, and a Strategic Cloud Engineer on an upcoming project that is TBA.</p>
      <h2>Where do I come from?</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Southern New Hampshire, just by the Maine border.
        I went to school in the Dover school system and grew up not having a lot. 
        There were many opportunities I didn't get that a lot of others did, and I struggled
        my way into Plymouth State University, where I graduated a semester early with a Bachelor's
        in Computer Science. During the time I was enrolled there, I took up an internship
        with a small Managed Service Provider called Nessit, based in Somersworth NH, where
        I gained a lot of experience working with Networking Infrastructure, Systems Adminstration, 
        and working in a Helpdesk role. During this time, I also worked for PSU's Classroom Technology
        Services team, troubleshooting most of the school's A/V problems.</p> 
      <h2>My Path to Google</h2>
      <p>
        My life changed forever when 
        in September of 2021 I got a call from a Google recruiter, asking me to interview for the Cloud Technical
        Residency program. At first, I thought this was fake, but I set up a call with the recruiter anyway
        and she told me about the program and all of the things it could offer me. Naturally, I dropped everything
        and accepted. I started the interview process, and focused on studying for the interviews
        for weeks. Now, I am not one to study; Having ADHD makes this a very challenging task for me,
        but I knew that this opportunity would be worth it, even if I didn't get the job. At least I could say that I tried.
        Needless to say, based on my GitHub profile, I got the job! It still wasn't smooth sailing, however.
        I had to completely uproot my life in New Hampshire to move to Atlanta, Georgia; A thousand miles
        away from my home, a completely unknown land where I knew no one. Leaving my family
        was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, but it was worth it for a chance to 
        improve myself, and eventually give back to them because they deserve the world, and if I can give even
        the littlest bit back to them, I think it's worth it.

      <h2>Now, Why Do <i>You</i> Care</h2>
      <p>
        Well, you might not, but this was all a long winded life story to tell you this;
        I want to help people get to my position in any way that I can. I grew up poor, with
        no opportunities, and I didn't care at all about my education until I got to college,
        I want to use my experience, my privelege to be working at Google, and my resources to
        help as many people as possible. Be that one, or one thousand, so this page is meant to inspire,
        but more importantly, to encourage you to reach out to me! Please, send me an email at chenderson1190@gmail.com,
        and I will help you achieve your goals in the IT industry in any way that I can; be that networking, tutorials,
        code review, or even just someone to bounce ideas off of.
